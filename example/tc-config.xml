      Terracotta Integration Modules (TIM) allow sets of configuration elements to
      be packaged together as a single, includable module within the Terracotta
      configuration.

      The catalog of available configuration modules will grow as new technologies
      are integrated with Terracotta. Community-developed configuration modules are
      also welcome and may be featured in the Forge.

      The <modules/> configuration below shows how to use a TIM as well as specify
      additional locations where TIM's may be found.
