# clj-env-dir Launches Clojure, passing along command line arguments. This
#             launcher is configured using environment variables and sets
#             up CLASSPATH based on the contents of a specified directory.
#
# scgilardi (gmail)
# Created 7 January 2009
#
# Environment variables:
#
# Required:
#
#  CLOJURE_EXT  The path to a directory containing (either directly or as
#               symbolic links) jar files and/or directories whose paths
#               should be in Clojure's classpath. The value of the
#               CLASSPATH environment variable for Clojure will be a list
#               of these paths followed by the previous value of CLASSPATH
#               (if any).
#
# Optional:
#
#  CLOJURE_JAVA The command to launch a JVM instance for Clojure
#               default: java
#               example: /usr/local/bin/java6
#
#  CLOJURE_OPTS Java options for this JVM instance
#               default:
#               example:"-Xms32M -Xmx128M -server"
#
#  CLOJURE_MAIN The Java class to launch
#               default: clojure.main
#               example: clojure.contrib.repl_ln
