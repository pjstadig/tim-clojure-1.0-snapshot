Quickstart Guide

	The {{{installation.html}Install Guide}} has instructions on how to install this Integration Module.

* Using a Terracotta Integration Module

	To use an Integration Module you will need to tell Terracotta where it should look. This varies slightly
	depending on where you installed your Integration Module.

** Using a TIM Installed in the Local Maven Repository

	If you are using the {{{http://forge.terracotta.org/releases/projects/tc-maven-plugin} Maven Plugin for Terracotta}} then you wont
	need to do anything.

	If not, then you will have to add a <<<\<repository/\>>>> section in your <<<tc-config.xml>>> file to tell
	Terracotta where it can find these modules:

---
<clients>
   <modules>
      <repository>%(user.home)/.m2/repository</repository>
      <module name="${project.artifactId}"
         version="${project.version}"
         group-id="${project.groupId}"/>
   </modules>
</clients>
---

 	--- assuming that your local Maven repository is at:

---
~/.m2/repository
---

** Using a TIM Installed in the Local Terracotta Installation

	You don't need to do anything else. Terracotta will always look for Integration Modules in its
	<<<modules>>> folder in addition to the other repositories that you list in your <<<tc-config.xml>>>
	file.

	You will still need to declare which Integration Module you would like to load on startup:

---
<clients>
   <modules>
      <module name="${project.artifactId}"
         version="${project.version}"
         group-id="${project.groupId}"/>
   </modules>
</clients>
---

** Using a TIM Installed in an Arbitrary Location

	You will have to add a <<<\<repository/\>>>> section in your <<<tc-config.xml>>> file to tell
	Terracotta where it can find these modules:

---
<clients>
   <modules>
      <repository>%(user.home)/terracotta-modules</repository>
      <module name="${project.artifactId}"
         version="${project.version}"
         group-id="${project.groupId}"/>
   </modules>
</clients>
---
